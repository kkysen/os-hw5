libfridge
=========

A simple library that wraps system calls created for a kernel key-value store.

Building libfridge
------------------

This library is built and installed using a custom Makefile.

To this library:

    $ make

Then, to install this library:

    # make install


### Install destination

This Makefile will install the library and headers to the path defined by
`FRIDGE_DEST`. Specifically, the library will placed under `$(FRIDGE_DEST)/lib`,
and the headers will be placed under `$(FRIDGE_DEST)/include`.

By default, `FRIDGE_DEST` is set to `/usr/local`.

The install location may be overridden by defining `FRIDGE_DEST` as an
environment variable. For example:

    $ FRIDGE_DEST=custom/path make install


### Makefile

Here are some useful targets defined in the Makefile:

`make`/`make default`:  Defaults to `make build`

`make build`:           Builds `libfridge.a`

`make install`:         Installs `libfridge.a` and `fridge.h` to `FRIDGE_DEST`

`make uninstall`:       Removes `libfridge.a` and `fridge.h` from `FRIDGE_DEST`

`make clean`:           Removes build products

`make help`:            Prints a list of useful PHONY targets


How to Use
----------
Simply install the library include the header file: `#include <fridge.h>`.
You must also link with the library: -lfridge. Because the header and
library will be in system directories, you do not need to pass -I and -L
flags to your compiler.
